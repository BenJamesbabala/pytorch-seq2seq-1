#SeqWithAttention

This repository contains an implementation of an LSTM sequence to sequence model in PyTorch. Right now, the implementation is pretty basic and I'm using it on a toy task (an autoencoder for sentences). The source material is sentences from the Jane Austen collection (downloaded on Project Gutenberg, included in this repo). 

Currently it's only tested in Python 2.7.

## requirements

Latest versions of the following:
* Python 2.7 (at least, that's what I'm using to test it)
* PyTorch
* spaCy
* unidecode
* numpy
* cPickle

## contributing

Let me know if you spot any issues, and please submit a pull request if you have suggestions!!
